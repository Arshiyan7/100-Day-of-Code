# Day 1-10 (Arrays) Challenge

This folder contains solutions to array-based problems for Days 1-10 of the 100 Days of Code challenge. Each script focuses on a specific problem-solving concept using arrays.

## Problems Solved

### Day 1: Find Min and Max
- **File:** `Day01_min_max.py`
- **Description:** Finds the minimum and maximum elements in an array.

### Day 2: Find Pairs for Target Sum
- **File:** `Day02_finding_pair.py`
- **Description:** Finds pairs in an array that sum up to a given target value.

### Day 3: Rotate Array by K Places
- **File:** `day03_reverse_by_k.py`
- **Description:** Rotates an array by `k` positions.

### Day 4: Reverse an Array
- **File:** `day04_reverse.py`
- **Description:** Reverses the given array.

### Day 5: Find Second Largest Element
- **File:** `day05_second_largest.py`
- **Description:** Identifies the second largest element in an array.

### Day 6: Merge and Sort Two Arrays
- **File:** `day06_sort_merge.py`
- **Description:** Merges two sorted arrays and sorts the final array.

### Day 7: Subarray Matching
- **File:** `day07_sub_array.py`
- **Description:** Checks if a subarray exists within a given array.

### Day 8: Move Zeros to End
- **File:** `day08_place_zeros_end.py`
- **Description:** Moves all zeros in an array to the end while maintaining the order of other elements.

### Day 9: find longest sub Array
- **File:** `day09_Longest_SubArray.py`
- **Description:** find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum, subarray, and length.

## Day 10: find zero in sub Array
- **File:** `day10_zero_in_Sub_Array.py`
- **Description:**  Checks if a subarray with a sum of zero exists in a given array.

## How to Run the Scripts
Each Python file can be executed using:
```bash
python filename.py
```
Replace `filename.py` with the actual file name.

## Notes
- All solutions are written in Python.
- The scripts are optimized for readability and efficiency.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
