# Day 11-18 (Strings) Challenge

This folder contains solutions to String-based problems for Days 11-18 of the 100 Days of Code challenge. Each script focuses on a specific problem-solving concept using Strings.

## Problems Solved

### Day 1: Reverse a String
- **File:** `day01_reverse_string.py`
- **Description:** take input from user and reverse that input for example input = arsh,
output = hsra.

### Day 2: Check Palindrome
- **File:** `day02_check_Palindrome.py`
- **Description:** take input from user and check if the input is palindrome i.e. same answer after reversing the string. for example: input = asa, output = asa -> Palindrome, input = abc, output = bca -> Not a Palindrome

### Day 3: Return Non-Repeating String
- **File:** `day03_non_repeating.py`
- **Description:** take input from user and return the first letter that is non repeating, for example: input = aarshh, output = r is first non repeating

### Day 3: Check Anagram
- **File:** `day04_anagram.py`
- **Description:** take two inputs from user and check if two numbers has same frequency no matter what the order is: input = silent, listen, output = anagram because (both has same frequencies i.e.)
{'l': 1, 'i': 1, 's': 1, 't': 1, 'e': 1, 'n': 1}
{'s': 1, 'i': 1, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, 'n': 1, 't': 1}


## How to Run the Scripts
Each Python file can be executed using:
```bash
python filename.py
```
Replace `filename.py` with the actual file name.

## Notes
- All solutions are written in Python.
- The scripts are optimized for readability and efficiency.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
